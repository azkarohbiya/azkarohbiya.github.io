## ❓ Background

### Why you can't use LLM to decide positive or negative feedbacks.

Tagging sentiment of feedbacks can be exhausting especially dealing with large amount of feedbacks. In addition, some companies might restrict the use of AI because of potentially revealing the secrets, unless you totally trust to AI CEO's. In another case, probably you want to train AI by creating reliable raw data. Therefore, this article is going to discuss how to annotate text sentiment by combining word-cloud and graph in python.

## Real Scenario

### IMDb (Internet Movie Database) ratings

In this case, there are around 400K feedbacks, giving comments about their experience watching various movies. Yet, these feedbacks still require further cleansing since they are extracted using machine before directly analyzing it. To resolve this issue, I used three following methods.

| Method      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stopwords   | Several words do not contain useful meaning, and they are typically used in every phase so they might interfere the most frequent words. Therefore, this step skips those words                                  |
| HTML syntax | as these comments are generated by machine, some coding words are detected. So, this process removes them.                                                                                                       |
| Lemmitizer  | Grammatical rules make english words having so many branches, even though the meanings remain the same. For example, "ate" and "eaten" come from "eat". Therefor, this part returns all the braches to the root. |
