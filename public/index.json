One of the most trusted ways to understand this phenomenon by using AB testing experiment, splitting a group to target subgroup, who is allowed to smoke, and the control one who isn\u0026rsquo;t, then comparing them afterwards. On the other hand, doing such an experiment can be hardly executed due to ethical reasons. Likewise, a similar challenge also happens to the other sector like marketing, the field where I\u0026rsquo;m working. Consequently, measuring the existing data, comparing smokers and non-smokers, is an effective option to answer the hypothesis.\n📉 The bias comes here #Here is the twist, after learning the two groups (the smokers and those who don\u0026rsquo;t), we found that the two have different physical condition such as age, weight, and other status. As a result, comparing stroke status of both groups can be bias since those difference could interfere the output\n🎯 The solution #To resolve the issue, propensity matching score, as a part of causal approach, can be implemented to match the available data of the two in the same profile, ensuring the making the decision based on apple-to-apple comparison.\n🧮 Into Matching Algorithm #🤖 A brief of algorithm #The main calculation is finding every smoker\u0026rsquo;s pair. This looks easy until so many features we have to involve in the calculation. This is very similar in seeking a couple, which is getting more complex to match all the criteria. To address this, probability score of logistic regression is used, representing all features, than finding the pair using neighbor algorithm. For your information, I used sklearn neigbor finder to solve computational issues, as this is compatible for handling large amount of data.\n⬆️ the Improvement #When it comes to big data, calculating propensity score matching requires so much computational process, as the algorithm involves combination. That\u0026rsquo;s the reason why my team designed our own algorithm, despite the availibility out there. The algorithm we made approximately can handle around ~10 millions. According to my experience, it took minutes to complete calculation using M1 apple sillicon. So, it eventually depends on the computing power.\nFor detail explanation about technical details, including how to use my library and to call the syntax, please refer to my github:\nView on GitHub To find out more about the algorithm, you better watch this youtube video: Insight Explaination #The data #Explain about the feature, Treatment, and Outcome Add a table here to tell a lil bit about the data\nMatching # Evaluation #Microsoft Big data\n","date":"1 December 2023","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/propensity_score_matching/","section":"Projects","summary":"The algorithm that helps to find artificial control group for apple-to-apple comparison, avoiding bias in measurement impacts","title":"Propensity Score Matching"},{"content":"Testing Testing #How to be a millionare\nColumn1 Column2 Column3 Item1 Item1 Item1 test\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/forth-post/","section":"Projects","summary":"Personalized offer optimization using segmentation","title":"Forth Post"},{"content":" Best Projects #These are examples of what I made in my company to solve real problems through data approaches.\nSequential Recommender SystemGrowing the digital revenue around 150% percentThis model was used to enhance collaborative filtering approach, offering digital subscription products.
